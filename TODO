1. Add a decent command line interface

X 2. Add patches for using the newer kernel's /proc method of discovering what
     lp ports are attached. Make it work with both new and old
     Basically clean up its actions related to the LP port.

X 3. Fix coredump when run as non-root/non-suid

4. Freeze and release v2.3.0

5. Add a switch for 16f84 that inverts the sense of the PWEN config bit
   Uhh, what was this? I need the data sheets for the serially programmable
   processors.

X 6. Fix string copies that don't check for the length, home directory
     especially.

X 7. Integrate the /proc/ioports patches from Lee Olson
     Or maybe rewrite to use kernel lowlevel parallel port driver module? I
     don't like having to use the iopl(3) to gain permission to the higher
     port numbers. It may have to do for this release though.

8. Dynamically allocate lp_table space, based on the info snarfed from the
   /proc/ioports output.

9. Dynamically allocate memory based on the processor configured for, check
   the current list of PIC processors that this can support and add any that
   are new to a list to be selected from.

10. Support any other serially programmable PIC parts.
